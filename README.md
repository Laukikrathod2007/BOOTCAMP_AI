# Bootcamp on Artificial Intelligence

## Practical Assignment – 4

### Basic Image Processing using OpenCV

---

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to perform basic image processing operations using OpenCV, including loading an image, converting to grayscale, resizing, applying blur filters, edge detection, drawing shapes, and gray-level slicing.

---

## Tasks Completed

| Task No. | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Loaded the image using OpenCV |
| 2 | Converted the image to grayscale |
| 3 | Resized the image while maintaining aspect ratio |
| 4 | Applied Gaussian blur (3×3, 5×5, 7×7) |
| 5 | Performed Canny edge detection with different thresholds |
| 6 | Drew rectangles (red) and circles (green) |
| 7 | Applied gray-level slicing (with and without background) |
| 8 | Saved all processed images |
